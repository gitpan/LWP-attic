The LWP-attic distribution contains old and depreciated modules from
the libwww-perl distribution.  These modules are provided for old code
that happens to depend on them somehow.


LWP::Socket
LWP::SecureSocket

  The LWP protocol modules have been rewritten and is now based on the
  IO::Socket::INET modules in the standard perl distribution.
